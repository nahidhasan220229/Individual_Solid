/**
 * In this example, the Account interface defines a common method getBalance() 
   for getting the balance of different types of bank accounts. 
   Both SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount classes implement this interface 
   and provide their own implementations of the getBalance() method.

* The AccountBalanceCalculator class adheres to the Open/Closed Principle 
  by accepting an array of Account objects and calculating 
  the total balance without needing to modify its code 
  when new account types are introduced. This allows for easy extension 
  of the functionality without modifying existing code.
